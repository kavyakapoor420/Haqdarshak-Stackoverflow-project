# AI-Powered Community / Knowledge Base Project for Haqdarshak Agents

---

##  Project Context

Over the past 9 years, **Haqdarshak** has trained **40,000+ agents** to support citizens with welfare scheme access.  
These agents—along with coordinators—hold critical knowledge on **exception handling, grievance resolution, and scheme-specific workflows**.

However, this institutional knowledge is **fragmented** and **underutilized**.

This project aims to build an **AI-powered knowledge-sharing system** where:

- Agents can **ask and answer questions**.
- Verified learnings are **added to a central knowledge base**.
- A **community-driven ecosystem** grows organically — like a *StackOverflow for Scheme Agents*.
- Engagement improves, leading to **better retention and performance**.
